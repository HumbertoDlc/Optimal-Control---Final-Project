# Optimal-Control---Final-Project

1. OP_Project.m performs the symbolic calculation of the optimal control law, states and costates equations.

2. The symbolic variables are replaced on the code OP_Gradient.m. Then, the optimization is performed and the states are saved.

3. Simulation.m performs the simulation using the states saved from the OP_Gradient.m
